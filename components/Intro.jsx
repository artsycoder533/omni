          I'm so glad you asked! Research shows that over 50 million Americans
          have experienced problems with mental health symptoms or have
          documented mental health conditions. Studies have also found that 25
          million Americans struggle with substance use problems, while at least
          1 in 4 people suffer from both mental health and substance use
          disorders. Considering these statistics, I would say that a lot of
          people would benefit from participating in therapy. Be it the need for
          general support, help managing bipolar, anxiety, or depression; or
          addressing the impact of trauma, LBGTQ issues, or substance use; many
          of us could benefit from therapy at some point in our lifetimes. Of
          this need, Omni Addiction & Mental Health Services was founded to make
          more behavioral health services available to the communities of
          Southside VA and beyond. We gladly accept self-referrals as well as
          probation & court-ordered referrals.
